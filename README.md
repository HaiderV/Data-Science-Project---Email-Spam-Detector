Data-Science-Project---Email-Spam-Detector
A machine learning-based project that classifies emails as Spam or Not Spam.
It uses NLP techniques to clean and tokenize text, then applies a trained model to predict spam probability.

Features:
<ul>
<li>Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenizing)</li>
<li>ML model trained on labeled email data</li>
<li>Simple input prompt for testing custom emails</li>
<li>Easy to extend with more data and better models</li>
</ul

Tech Stack:
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>TensorFlow</li>
<li>NLP preprocessing libraries</li>
</ul>

How it works?
<ol>
<li>Enter an email</li>
<li>The text is processed and converted into numerical features</li>
<li>The model predicts whether it's spam</li>
<li>Shows output instantly</li>
</ul>
